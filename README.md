# Side Menu and Bottom Bar Navigation with Toast Feedback
# Overview
This project demonstrates a navigation setup in an Android application using both a side menu (Navigation Drawer) and a bottom navigation bar. It incorporates toast messages to provide user feedback when navigating between different fragments.

# Features
Side Menu Navigation: Utilizes a NavigationView for the side menu (Navigation Drawer) to switch between fragments. Toast messages are displayed to notify users of their selection.
Bottom Navigation Bar: Implements a BottomNavigationView to allow navigation between fragments. The bottom bar also provides feedback through toast messages.
Fragment Transitions: Defines navigation actions within the navigation graph to enable smooth transitions between fragments.
